# Overview of the Declarative Agent with API Plugin template

## Build a Declarative Agent with API Plugin from a new API with Azure Functions

With the declarative agent, you can build a custom version of Copilot that can be used for specific scenarios, such as for specialized knowledge, implementing specific processes, or simply to save time by reusing a set of AI prompts. For example, a grocery shopping Copilot declarative agent can be used to create a grocery list based on a meal plan that you send to Copilot.

You can extend declarative agents using plugins to retrieve data and execute tasks on external systems. A declarative agent can utilize multiple plugins at the same time.

1. First, select the Teams Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
2. In the Account section, sign in with your [Microsoft 365 account](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts) if you haven't already.
3. Select `Debug in Copilot (Edge)` or `Debug in Copilot (Chrome)` from the launch configuration dropdown.
4. Select your declarative agent from the `Copilot` app.
5. Send a message to Copilot to find a repair record.
