# Chat With Semantic Kernel and Plugins 

## Summary

This solution demonstrates an intelligent chat interface built with SharePoint Framework (SPFx) that integrates with Azure Functions and Microsoft Semantic Kernel. The chat webpart provides a modern conversational UI with real-time communication using Server-Sent Events (SSE), allowing users to interact with AI-powered capabilities directly within SharePoint Online.

The backend leverages Azure Functions with .NET 10 and Semantic Kernel for orchestrating AI interactions, including function calling capabilities for context-aware operations such as retrieving dates, user information, and calendar data from Microsoft Graph. The entire solution is protected by Entra ID (Azure AD) authentication.

Key features include:
- Real-time chat streaming with SSE
- Semantic Kernel integration with extensible function calling
- Semantic Kernel Plugins with Graph Calls
- Secure authentication via Entra ID
